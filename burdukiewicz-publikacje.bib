  abstract = {Amplification curves from quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments typically exhibit a sigmoidal shape. They can roughly be divided into a ground or baseline phase, an exponential amplification phase, a linear phase and finally a plateau phase, where in the latter, the PCR product concentration no longer increases. Nevertheless, in some cases the plateau phase displays a negative trend, e.g. in hydrolysis probe assays. This cycle-to-cycle fluorescence decrease is commonly referred to in the literature as the hook effect. Other detection chemistries also exhibit this negative trend, however the underlying molecular mechanisms are different. In this study we present two approaches to automatically detect hook effect-like curvatures based on linear (hookreg) and nonlinear regression (hookregNL). As the hook effect is typical for qPCR data, both algorithms can be employed for the automated identification of regular structured qPCR curves. Therefore, our algorithms streamline quality control, but can also be used for assay optimization or machine learning.},

  abstract = {Amyloids are proteins associated with several clinical disorders, including Alzheimer's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's. Despite their diversity, all amyloid proteins can undergo aggregation initiated by short segments called hot spots. To find the patterns defining the hot spots, we trained predictors of amyloidogenicity, using n-grams and random forest classifiers. Since the amyloidogenicity may not depend on the exact sequence of amino acids but on their more general properties, we tested 524,284 reduced amino acid alphabets of different lengths (three to six letters) to find the alphabet providing the best performance in cross-validation. The predictor based on this alphabet, called AmyloGram, was benchmarked against the most popular tools for the detection of amyloid peptides using an external data set and obtained the highest values of performance measures (AUC: 0.90, MCC: 0.63). Our results showed sequential patterns in the amyloids which are strongly correlated with hydrophobicity, a tendency to form {$\beta$}-sheets, and lower flexibility of amino acid residues. Among the most informative n-grams of AmyloGram we identified 15 that were previously confirmed experimentally. AmyloGram is available as the web-server: http://smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/shiny/AmyloGram/ and as the R package AmyloGram.

  abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constitute a diverse group of bioactive molecules that provide multicellular organisms with protection against microorganisms, and microorganisms with weaponry for competition. Some AMPs can target cancer cells; thus, they are called anticancer peptides (ACPs). Due to their small size, positive charge, hydrophobicity and amphipathicity, AMPs and ACPs interact with negatively charged components of biological membranes. AMPs preferentially permeabilize microbial membranes, but ACPs additionally target mitochondrial and plasma membranes of cancer cells. The preference towards mitochondrial membranes is explained by their membrane potential, membrane composition resulting from \&alpha;-proteobacterial origin and the fact that mitochondrial targeting signals could have evolved from AMPs. Taking into account the therapeutic potential of ACPs and millions of deaths due to cancer annually, it is of vital importance to find new cationic peptides that selectively destroy cancer cells. Therefore, to reduce the costs of experimental research, we have created a robust computational tool, CancerGram, that uses n-grams and random forests for predicting ACPs. Compared to other ACP classifiers, CancerGram is the first three-class model that effectively classifies peptides into: ACPs, AMPs and non-ACPs/non-AMPs, with AU1U amounting to 0.89 and a Kappa statistic of 0.65. CancerGram is available as a web server and R package on GitHub.},

However, little information is available how to statistically compare dPCR runs of multiple runs or reduplicates. The comparison of {$\lambda$} values from several runs is a multiple comparison problem, which can be solved using the binary structure of dPCR data. We propose and evaluate two novel methods based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multiple Ratio Tests (MRT) for comparison of digital PCR experiments. We enriched our MRT framework with computation of simultaneous confidence intervals suitable for comparing multiple dPCR runs. The evaluation of both statistical methods support that MRT is faster and more robust for dPCR experiments performed in large scale. Our theoretical results were confirmed by the analysis of dPCR measurements of dilution series. Both methods were implemented in the dpcR package (v. 0.2) for the open source R statistical computing environment.},

Our rudimentary knowledge of microbes stems from difficulties concerning their isolation and culture in laboratory conditions, which is necessary for describing their phenotype, among other things, for biotechnological purposes. An important component of the understudied ecosystems is methanogens, archaea producing a potent greenhouse-effect gas methane. Therefore, we created PhyMet2, the first database that combines descriptions of methanogens and their culturing conditions with genetic information. The database contains a set of utilities that facilitate interactive data browsing, data comparison, phylogeny exploration and searching for sequence homologues. The most unique feature of the database is the web server MethanoGram, which can be used to significantly reduce the time and cost of searching for the optimal culturing conditions of methanogens by predicting them based on 16S RNA sequences. The database will aid many researchers in exploring the world of methanogens and their applications in biotechnological processes.

The significance of signal peptides stimulates development of new computational methods for their detection. These methods employ learning systems trained on datasets comprising signal peptides from different types of proteins and taxonomic groups. As a result, the accuracy of predictions are high in the case of signal peptides that are well-represented in databases, but might be low in other, atypical cases. Such atypical signal peptides are present in proteins found in apicomplexan parasites, causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Apicomplexan proteins have a unique amino acid composition due to their AT-biased genomes. Therefore, we designed a new, more flexible and universal probabilistic model for recognition of atypical eukaryotic signal peptides. Our approach called signalHsmm includes knowledge about the structure of signal peptides and physicochemical properties of amino acids. It is able to recognize signal peptides from the malaria parasites and related species more accurately than popular programs. Moreover, it is still universal enough to provide prediction of other signal peptides on par with the best preforming predictors.},

AMPs are considered an important alternative to traditional antibiotics, especially at the time when multidrug-resistant bacteria being on the rise. Therefore, to reduce the costs of experimental research, robust computational tools for AMP prediction and identification of the best AMP candidates are essential. AmpGram is our novel tool for AMP prediction; it outperforms top-ranking AMP classifiers, including AMPScanner, CAMPR3R and iAMPpred. It is the first AMP prediction tool created for longer AMPs and for high-throughput proteomic screening. AmpGram prediction reliability was confirmed on the example of lactoferrin and thrombin. The former is a well known antimicrobial protein and the latter a cryptic one. Both proteins produce (after protease treatment) functional AMPs that have been experimentally validated at molecular level. The lactoferrin and thrombin AMPs were located in the antimicrobial regions clearly detected by AmpGram. Moreover, AmpGram also provides a list of shot 10 amino acid fragments in the antimicrobial regions, along with their probability predictions; these can be used for further studies and the rational design of new AMPs. AmpGram is available as a web-server, and an easy-to-use R package for proteomic analysis at CRAN repository.},

This is particularly pertinent in view of the growing number of functional (i.e., benign and useful) amyloid proteins discovered in bacteria. Here we identify two amyloidogenic proteins, Pr12 and Pr17, in fecal matter from PD transgenic rats and their wild type counterparts, based on their stability against dissolution by formic acid (FA). Both proteins show robust aggregation into ThT-positive aggregates that contain higher-order {$\beta$}-sheets and have a fibrillar morphology, indicative of amyloid proteins. In addition, Pr17 aggregates formed in vitro showed significant resistance against FA, suggesting an ability to form highly stable amyloid. Treatment with proteinase K revealed a protected core of approx. 9 kDa. Neither Pr12 nor Pr17, however, affected {$\alpha$}SN aggregation in vitro. Thus, amyloidogenicity does not per se lead to an ability to cross-seed fibrillation of {$\alpha$}SN. Our results support the use of proteomics and FA to identify amyloidogenic protein in complex mixtures and suggests that there may be numerous functional amyloid proteins in microbiomes.},

For example, cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of adult mortality worldwide. We have developed a rapidly adaptable platform to assess biomarkers using a microfluidic technology. Our model mimics autoantibodies against three proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cfmDNA) and DNA controls are detected via fluorescence probes. The biomarkers are covalently bound on the surface of size- (11\textendash 15 {$\mu$}m) and dual-color encoded microbeads and immobilized as planar layer in a microfluidic chip flow cell. Binding events of target molecules were analyzed by fluorescence measurements with a fully automatized fluorescence microscope (end-point and real-time) developed in house. The model system was optimized for buffers and immobilization strategies of the microbeads to enable the simultaneous detection of protein and DNA biomarkers. All prime target molecules (anti-CRP, anti-BNP, anti-LDL, cfmDNA) and the controls were successfully detected both in independent reactions and simultaneously. In addition, the biomarkers could also be detected in spiked human serum in a similar way as in the optimized buffer system. The detection limit specified by the manufacturer is reduced by at least a factor of five for each biomarker as a result of the antibody detection and kinetic experiments indicate that nearly 50 \% of the fluorescence intensity is achieved within 7 min. For rapid data inspection, we have developed the open source software digilogger, which can be applied for data evaluation and visualization. Open image in new window Graphical abstract},

Salmonella serotypes are differentiated into host-restricted and host-adapted specialists, and host-unrestricted generalists. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of host specificity in Salmonella infection, we investigated the role of the intestinal host cell receptor zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2), which is recognized by FimH adhesin of type 1 fimbriae found in Enterobacteriaceae. We compared four human and two porcine GP2 isoforms. Isoforms were expressed in Sf9 cells as well as in one human (HEp-2) and one porcine (IPEC-J2) cell line. FimH genes of 128 Salmonella isolates were sequenced and the 10 identified FimH variants were compared regarding adhesion (static adhesion assay) and infection (cell line assay) using an isogenic model. We expressed and characterized two functional porcine GP2 isoforms differing in their amino acid sequence to human isoforms by approximately 25\%. By comparing all isoforms in the static adhesion assay, FimH variants were assigned to high, low or no-binding phenotypes. This FimH variant-dependent binding was neither specific for one GP2 isoform nor for GP2 in general. However, cell line infection assays revealed fundamental differences: using HEp-2 cells, infection was also FimH variant-specific but mainly independent of human GP2. In contrast, this FimH variant dependency was not obvious using IPEC-J2 cells. Here, we propose an alternative GP2 adhesion/infection mechanism whereby porcine GP2 is not a receptor that determined host-specificity of Salmonella. Salmonella specialists as well as generalists demonstrated similar binding to GP2. Future studies should focus on spatial distribution of GP2 isoforms in the human and porcine intestine, especially comparing health and disease.},

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of publications on E. coli as calf pathogens and the role of calves as reservoir have not been done so far. We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods, and biological assays. The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals and was analyzed for time courses. Together, 106 papers with 25,982 E. coli isolates from 27 countries tested for VAFs were included. F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) - VAFs of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were significantly associated with calf diarrhea.

  abstract = {Reports on phase separation and amyloid formation for multiple proteins and aggregation-prone peptides are recurrently used to explore the molecular mechanisms associated with several human diseases. The information conveyed by these reports can be used directly in translational investigation, e.g., for the design of better drug screening strategies, or be compiled in databases for benchmarking novel aggregation-predicting algorithms. Given that minute protocol variations determine different outcomes of protein aggregation assays, there is a strong urge for standardized descriptions of the different types of aggregates and the detailed methods used in their production. In an attempt to address this need, we assemble the Minimum Information Required for Reproducible Aggregation Experiments (MIRRAGGE) guidelines, considering first-principles and the established literature on protein self-assembly and aggregation. This consensus information aims to cover the major and subtle determinants of experimental reproducibility while avoiding excessive technical details that are of limited practical interest for non-specialized users. The MIRRAGGE table (template available in supplementary information) is useful as a guide for the design of new studies and as a checklist during submission of experimental reports for publication. Full disclosure of relevant information also enables other researchers to reproduce results correctly and facilitates systematic data deposition into curated databases.},

The biofilm formation, phylogrouping and detection of biofilm-associated genes were further analyzed. Out of a total number of 280 samples that were collected, 216 E. coli strains were isolated. The prevalence of isolating E. coli from humans (96\%) was higher than from animals (89\%) and about 38.8\% were isolated from animal food products. Out of these 216 E. coli isolates that were tested for antibiotic sensitivity, 37 were multidrug-resistant. The prevalence of isolating these multi-resistant strains was highest in the animal category (23.6\%) followed by the animal food products (16.1\%) and the human category (11.5\%). All the multidrug-resistant isolates were capable of forming biofilm, which varied significantly with each isolate. The majority of isolates belonged to phylogroup B1.

  abstract = {The ratio between living and dead cells is an important parameter in microalgae culture and environmental monitoring. Fast, robust and automated analytical methods for monitoring microalgae growth for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications and for optimizing production strains are needed. We developed a pipeline for the automatic binary classification of living and dead microalgae. We compared multispectral fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry as readout platforms. Images of Chlorella vulgaris suspension cultures were captured and features of microalgaes (e.g., size) were extracted by bioimage informatics. We classified the microalgae cells with seven machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Neural Networks. Random Forest was a particularly suitable method for classifying the living/dead microalgae population, the label-free classifier can reach 86\% of the area under the curve (AUC) if only morphological characteristics are used. The AUC rose to 99.6\% if the fluorescence signal of Syto 9 (dye for all cells) and Propidium iodide (dye for damaged cells) were added as features, and the prediction accuracy reached 96.6\% which is over the accuracy of 95\% from the cell viability analysis using the staining method. This means that our classifier is useful as it improves the staining method by correcting 30\% of the false positive/negative cells. Instead of only predicting single cells, we developed a Random Forest model to classify the distribution of living and dead microalgae populations using the fingerprint vector features, which gives an overall AUC of 94.5\% and accuracy of 82\%. We found that dead cells are significantly larger in average diameter (1.4-fold, p~{$<~$}0.01) and area (1.5-fold, p~{$<~$}0.01) when compared to living cells. In summary, combinations of statistical methods, bioimage informatics and machine learning are useful approaches for automated investigation in analyzing population dynamics of microalgae cultures.},

Numerous real-time read-out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification-based techniques, there are only few tools for pre-processing of amplification data. However, a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example, during the development of new instruments.Results:chipPCR is an R package for the pre-processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplification curves. The package takes advantage of R's S4 object model and offers an extensible environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R, such as a 5-point stencil for derivative interpolation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification efficiency/quantification cycle calculation, and datasets from qPCR and qIA experiments are part of the package. Core functionalities are integrated in GUIs (web-based and standalone shiny applications), thus streamlining analysis and report generation.Availability and implementation:http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chipPCR.

  abstract = {Bacterial biofilm formation is a widespread phenomenon and a complex process requiring a set of genes facilitating the initial adhesion, maturation, production of extracellular polymeric matrix (EPS) and subsequent dispersal of bacteria. Most studies on Escherichia coli (E. coli) biofilm formation have investigated non-pathogenic E. coli K-12 strains. Due to the extensive focus on laboratory strains in most studies, there is poor information regarding biofilm formation by pathogenic E. coli isolates. In this study, we genotypically and phenotypically characterized 187 human clinical E. coli isolates representing various pathotypes (e.g., uropathogenic, enteropathogenic and enteroaggregative E. coli). We investigated the presence of biofilm-associated genes (``genotype'') and phenotypically analyzed the isolates for motility, curli and cellulose production (``phenotype''). We developed a new screening method to examine the in vitro biofilm formation ability. In summary, we found a high prevalence of biofilm-associated genes. However, we could not detect a biofilm-associated gene or specific phenotype correlating with the biofilm formation ability. In contrast, we could identify an association of increased biofilm formation with a specific E. coli pathotype. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) were found to exhibit the highest capacity of biofilm formation. Using our image-based technology for the screening of biofilm formation, we have demonstrated the characteristic biofilm formation pattern of EAEC, consisting of thick bacterial aggregates. In summary, our results highlight the fact that biofilm-promoting factors shown to be critical for biofilm formation in non-pathogenic strains do not reflect their impact in clinical isolates and that the ability of biofilm formation is a defined characteristic for EAEC. IMPORTANCE Bacterial biofilms are ubiquitous and consist of sessile bacterial cells surrounded by a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix. They cause chronic and device-related infections due to their high resistance to antibiotics and the host immune system. In non-pathogenic E. coli cell surface components playing a pivotal role in biofilm formation are well known. In contrast, there is poor information for their role in biofilm formation of pathogenic isolates. Our study provides insights into the correlation of biofilm-associated genes or specific phenotypes with the biofilm formation ability of commensal and pathogenic E. coli. Additionally, we represent a new developed method enabling qualitative biofilm analysis by automated image analysis which is beneficial for high-throughput screenings. Our results help to establish a better understanding of E. coli biofilm formation.},

Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data.We obtained published high-replicate qPCR data sets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and AE.Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and AE considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all qPCR scenarios. The Savitzky\textendash Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in qPCR AE, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an AE-dependent bias.The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time PCR experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic qPCR applications. The findings of our study were implemented in the R packages chipPCR and qpcR as a basis for the implementation of an analytical strategy.},

This behavior is seen for technical replicate datasets recorded on several different commercial instruments; it occurs in the baseline region and typically increases with increasing cycle number in the growth and plateau regions. Autocorrelation analysis reveals periodicities of 12 for 96-well systems and 24 for a 384-well system, indicating a correlation with block architecture. Passive dye experiments show that the effect may be from optical detector bias. Importantly, the signal periodicity manifests as periodicity in quantification cycle (Cq) values when these are estimated by the widely applied fixed threshold approach, but not when scale-insensitive markers like first- and second-derivative maxima are used. Accordingly, any scale variability in the growth curves will lead to bias in constant-threshold-based Cqs, making it mandatory that workers should either use scale-insensitive Cqs or normalize their growth curves to constant amplitude before applying the constant threshold method.},

This is preceded by formation of oligomers\textemdash the most cytotoxic species. Determining amyloidogenicity is tedious and costly. The most reliable identification of amyloids is obtained with high resolution microscopies, such as electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy (AFM). More frequently, less expensive and faster methods are used, especially infrared (IR) spectroscopy or Thioflavin T staining. Different experimental methods are not always concurrent, especially when amyloid peptides do not readily form fibrils but oligomers. This may lead to peptide misclassification and mislabeling. Several bioinformatics methods have been proposed for in-silico identification of amyloids, many of them based on machine learning. The effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on accurate annotation of the reference training data obtained from in-vitro experiments. We study how robust are bioinformatics methods to weak supervision, encountering imperfect training data. AmyloGram and three other amyloid predictors were applied. The results proved that a certain degree of misannotation in the reference data can be eliminated by the bioinformatics tools, even if they belonged to their training set. The computational results are supported by new experiments with IR and AFM methods.},

While initially focused on the study of biodiversity within these communities, the emphasis has increasingly shifted to the study of (changes in) the complete set of functions available in these communities. A key tool to study this functional complement of a microbiome is Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. However, comparing large sets of GO terms is not an easy task due to the deeply branched nature of GO, which limits the utility of exact term matching. To solve this problem, we here present MegaGO, a user-friendly tool that relies on semantic similarity between GO terms to compute the functional similarity between multiple data sets. MegaGO is high performing: Each set can contain thousands of GO terms, and results are calculated in a matter of seconds.
